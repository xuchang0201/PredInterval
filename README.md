# PGS-based phenotype prediction interval (PredInterval)

![alt text](https://github.com/xuchang0201/PredInterval/blob/main/PredInterval%20Schematic.tiff)
PredInterval is a statistical method that quantifies polygenic score (PGS)-based phenotype prediction uncertainty through the construction of well-calibrated prediction intervals. PredInterval is non-parametric in natural and extracts information based on quantiles of phenotypic residuals through cross-validations, thus achieving well-calibrated coverage of true phenotypic values. In addition, the PredInterval framework is general and can be paired with any PGS method or pre-computed SNP effect sizes obtained from publicly available resources.
